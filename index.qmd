I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at UCSB currently pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Studies. In addition to the usual ES coursework I have also participated in field work with sea turtles and will continue my field studies journey next fall by studying the ecosystem of Chilean Patagonia for a semester. In addition to this I am one of the coordinators of the Halal Kosher Grocery Program, which is a program through the Basic Needs department that packs weekly grocery bags with Halal and Kosher for students who demonstrate financial need.
