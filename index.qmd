I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at UCSB currently pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Studies. In addition to the usual ES coursework I have also participated in field work with sea turtles and will continue my field studies journey next fall by studying the ecosystem of Chilean Patagonia for a semester.
