# Things I love to do outside of school

#### Staying active

I've never really enjoyed going to the gym, but I do love to stay active. Over my 3 years at UCSB I have spent a lot of my time surfing, hiking, swimming, rock climbing, juggling, dancing, and, most recently, started learning parkour and jiu jitsu. I always enjoy learning a new physical skill and it's been really cool learning how to move in new and different ways.
