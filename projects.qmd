```{r}
library(magick)
```

Yes this was me I was the one who invented this

```{r}
horse <- magick::image_read("images/horse_for_git2.webp") #find the photo

horse_done <- image_scale(horse, "400")

grid::grid.raster(horse_done) #print it

```

I worked really hard inventing the horse I hope you like it.

I only made one though so if you see another one that's NOT one of mine that's a FAKE horse you should run away

```{r}
cumin <- magick::image_read("images/cumin-powder.jpg") #find the photo

cumin_done <- image_scale(cumin, "100")

grid::grid.raster(cumin_done) #
```

Yup I also invented cumin
